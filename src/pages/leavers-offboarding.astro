        I worked as an IA and RPA Developer. During this time, I used tools such
        as Automation Anywhere 360 and Postman to work on a significant project
        for Experian North America. The project involved automating the
        companyâ€™s offboarding process using the ServiceNow API. I used Postman
        for testing and Automation Anywhere for the final development.
        Additionally, I created Process Design Documents, worked with Splunk for
        monitoring, designed workflow diagrams, and developed wrappers.
